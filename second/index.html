            <p>Arnold ipsum. Just bodies. I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle. Grant me revenge! And if you do not listen, then to HELL with you. Make it quick because my horse is getting tired. Come on don't bullshit me. Into the tunnel. Bring your toy back to the carpet.</p>

        <div class="text">That is seventeen five - your half of the thirty-five thousand. Plus there's an extra fifteen in there, it's all yours, you've earned it. We made a deal. That's right. Because I think that we can do business together - we came to an understanding. Take a look at the money in your hand. Now just imagine making that every week. That's right. Two pounds a week, thirty-five thousand a pound.</div>
